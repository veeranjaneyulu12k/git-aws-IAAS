Sticky sessions (session affinity)

â€¢	It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to same instance behind a load balancer,
â€¢	The â€˜cookieâ€™ is used for stickiness has an expiration date you control 
â€¢	Nlb works without cookie


**Application- based cookies**

-Custom cookie
â€¢	Generated by target

-Application cookie
â€¢	Generated by load balancer (AWSALBAPP)

**Duration based cookies**

â€¢	Cookie generated by load balancer
â€¢	Cookie name is **AWSALB** for ALB, **AWSELB** for CLB

**2. SSL/TLS**

.An SSL certificate allows traffic b/w your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted (In-flight encryption)

**3. Connection Draining**
----------------------------

Connection Draining is a feature used in AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB/ALB/NLB) to ensure that in-flight requests are not interrupted when an instance is deregistered or becomes unhealthy.

**ðŸ”¹ What it does:**

When you deregister an instance from a load balancer or it becomes unhealthy:

The load balancer stops sending new requests to that instance.

Existing connections (in-flight requests) are allowed to finish within a specified timeout.

After the timeout expires, any remaining connections are forcibly closed.
