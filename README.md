Sticky sessions (session affinity)

•	It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to same instance behind a load balancer,
•	The ‘cookie’ is used for stickiness has an expiration date you control 
•	Nlb works without cookie


**Application- based cookies**

-Custom cookie
•	Generated by target

-Application cookie
•	Generated by load balancer (AWSALBAPP)

**Duration based cookies**

•	Cookie generated by load balancer
•	Cookie name is **AWSALB** for ALB, **AWSELB** for CLB
